**Dimensional Neutrality: A Unified View of Spacetime**

**By Iggy Gullstrand**

### Abstract

The distinction between time and space, long held as fundamental, may be an artifact of our observational perspective—akin to a flat Earth illusion in cosmology. Drawing inspiration from Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) and Dragan and Ekert's observer-dependent dimensional shifts, I propose that time and space are manifestations of a single, neutral manifold. The metric signatures (+ or -) reflect not inherent properties but the observer's frame of reference, particularly their speed relative to light. At this pivotal threshold, space may acquire directional properties like time, while time might become navigable like space. Incorporating insights from string theory and multi-dimensional models, I suggest time emerges from the Big Bang as a three-dimensional hypersphere rather than a one-dimensional line, and propose specific antiparticle anomalies as a testable signature. This framework challenges the conventional view of linear time, encouraging a fundamental reevaluation of spacetime's nature.

### 1. Introduction

Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) reimagines the Big Bang not as a beginning but as a transitional point in cosmic evolution. This perspective stretches our conception of time beyond conventional boundaries, yet still adheres to a linear temporal framework. This adherence to linearity appears increasingly analogous to early flat Earth cosmology—an incomplete picture based on limited observational capacity. The possibility that time might possess dimensionality beyond a simple line emerges when we consider the Big Bang as a central point from which dimensions radiate symmetrically.

This intuition gains theoretical support from Dragan and Ekert's "Quantum Principle of Relativity" (2020), which demonstrates how superluminal reference frames would transform our familiar 3+1 spacetime (three space dimensions plus one time dimension) into a 1+3 configuration. In such a framework, what we perceive as space would acquire time-like characteristics, while time would exhibit space-like properties. This transformation suggests that the fundamental distinction between time and space may be observational rather than intrinsic—determined by our frame of reference relative to the speed of light.

This paper explores the possibility that spacetime represents a unified, neutral manifold—a "chronospace" whose dimensions acquire specific time-like or space-like properties based on the observer's relationship to them. By integrating CCC's cyclical perspective, multi-dimensional insights, and string theory's dimensional flexibility, I propose a model where the traditional boundaries between time and space dissolve into a more fundamental unity.

### 2. Theoretical Foundations

#### 2.1 Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology

Penrose's CCC postulates an infinite series of universe cycles or "aeons," where each universe's remote future connects conformally with the next universe's Big Bang ([Penrose, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04835-5)). This model extends time beyond the conventional Big Bang boundary but maintains its one-dimensional character. Evidence supporting this theory includes potential observations of gravitational wave echoes from previous aeons, manifesting as concentric circles in the cosmic microwave background ([An et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty1089)).

CCC provides a crucial conceptual stepping stone, reimagining the Big Bang not as an absolute beginning but as a transitional point. However, it stops short of reconceptualizing time's dimensionality, maintaining the conventional view of time as a linear progression ([Woit, 2011](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=3734)).

#### 2.2 Dragan and Ekert's Observer-Dependent Spacetime

Dragan and Ekert's work reveals how the fundamental character of spacetime dimensions depends on the observer's reference frame ([Dragan & Ekert, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab76f7)). In standard 1+3 spacetime (one time dimension, three space dimensions), observers moving at superluminal speeds would perceive a metric signature shift from:

$$\eta_{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$$

to 

$$\eta_{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(1, -1, 1, 1)$$

This transformation converts one space dimension into a time-like character, while the original time dimension adopts space-like properties. The Lorentz transformations for a superluminal observer moving with velocity $V > c$ along the x-axis take the form:

$$x' = \frac{V t - x}{\sqrt{V^2 / c^2 - 1}}, \quad t' = \frac{t - (V/c^2)x}{\sqrt{V^2 / c^2 - 1}}$$

While superluminal travel remains physically prohibited under current understanding, this mathematical framework demonstrates that the distinction between time and space may be observer-dependent rather than absolute—a crucial insight for our neutral manifold hypothesis.

#### 2.3 Multi-Dimensional Time and String Theory

Several theoretical approaches have explored the possibility of multiple time dimensions. Bars' two-time (2T) physics proposes that our perceived (3+1)-dimensional world represents a "shadow" of a more fundamental (4+2)-dimensional reality ([Bars, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.64.126001)). This framework unifies various dynamical systems by showing they can be derived from a single action in the higher-dimensional space.

String theory and M-theory operate in higher-dimensional manifolds—10D (9+1) or 11D (10+1)—that begin with neutral characteristics prior to dimensional compactification ([Witten, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(95)00158-O)). The theory's T-duality, which equates physics in spaces of reciprocal size, hints at a deeper fungibility between dimensions. Similarly, F-theory's (2+10) framework suggests dimensional fluidity beyond the standard model ([Vafa, 1996](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602022)).

These approaches offer mathematical frameworks for modeling reality beyond conventional spacetime limitations, supporting the possibility that our perception of distinct time and space dimensions reflects observational constraints rather than fundamental reality.

### 3. A Unified Spacetime Model

I propose reframing spacetime as a four-dimensional neutral manifold—"chronospace"—where dimensions possess equivalent fundamental properties. The metric signature that distinguishes time-like from space-like dimensions (+--- or -+++) emerges not from intrinsic dimensional properties but from the observer's reference frame, particularly their velocity relative to the speed of light.

In subluminal reference frames, we perceive the conventional 1+3 configuration: one time dimension and three space dimensions. As Dragan and Ekert demonstrated, a hypothetical superluminal frame would perceive a 3+1 configuration, with three time-like dimensions and one space-like dimension. At the threshold speed of light, the distinction between time-like and space-like may blur completely, suggesting that from a photon's perspective, all dimensions might be equivalent.

This model proposes that time's apparent linearity and space's apparent extensivity represent emergent properties based on our specific observational limitations—similar to how a flat Earth appears reasonable from a limited vantage point. Drawing from CCC's cyclical perspective, I suggest the Big Bang represents a hyperspherical core from which all dimensions radiate symmetrically, rather than a point from which time uniquely extends as a one-dimensional line.

### 4. Observer-Dependent Dimensions

The observer-dependent nature of dimensions in this model can be formalized as follows: When an observer's velocity v < c (subluminal), one dimension manifests directional flow properties (time), while three dimensions appear static and navigable (space). As an observer's reference frame approaches c, this distinction begins to blur, potentially allowing limited non-linear temporal experiences (consistent with relativistic time dilation).

Beyond c, following Dragan and Ekert's analysis, space dimensions would acquire directional properties—unfolding like time—while time dimensions would become navigable, like space. This transformation can be represented mathematically as:

$$ds^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{4} \epsilon_i dx_i^2$$

where ε_i = ±1 depends on the observer's reference frame. The conventional assignment of ε₁ = -1 (for time) and ε₂,₃,₄ = +1 (for space) represents one possible configuration among many, determined by the observer's relationship to these dimensions.

### 5. Testing the Hypothesis

This model generates several potentially testable predictions:

1. **Antiparticle Behavior**: If time possesses three dimensions rather than one, antiparticles—conventionally interpreted as particles moving backward in one-dimensional time ([Feynman, 1949](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.76.749))—might represent particles moving through alternative time dimensions. This reinterpretation predicts subtle anomalies in antiparticle behavior, particularly in high-energy environments where dimensional boundaries might blur. Specifically, we might observe:
   - Unexplained variations in positron annihilation rates correlating with cosmic expansion
   - Subtle directional preferences in antiparticle decay that violate expected symmetries
   - Anomalous antiparticle production rates in particle accelerators at specific energy thresholds

2. **Cosmic Microwave Background Signatures**: If the Big Bang represents a hyperspherical core radiating in multiple time dimensions, this geometry might imprint distinctive patterns in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) beyond those predicted by standard inflationary models. Advanced statistical analysis of CMB data could reveal topological signatures consistent with multi-dimensional temporal expansion.

3. **Gravitational Wave Echoes**: Building on CCC, if previous cosmic cycles connect through multiple time dimensions, gravitational waves might travel through these additional temporal pathways, producing distinctive interference patterns detectable by advanced LIGO/Virgo observations or future gravitational wave detectors.

Experimental designs should focus on high-precision measurements in particle physics, particularly in environments where quantum effects become significant and conventional dimensional distinctions might weaken.

### 6. Implications and Challenges

The neutral manifold hypothesis carries profound implications for our understanding of physics:

1. **Causality Reconceptualization**: Multiple time dimensions would necessitate a fundamental reconsideration of causality. Traditional causal chains might branch into networks, potentially resolving quantum measurement paradoxes by allowing effects to precede causes along certain dimensional pathways while maintaining overall causal consistency ([Novikov, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.45.1989)).

2. **Quantum Non-locality**: The apparent "spooky action at a distance" in quantum entanglement might represent interactions through additional time dimensions, rendering them local in the higher-dimensional framework. This would provide a geometric interpretation of quantum phenomena without requiring instantaneous information transfer.

3. **Cosmic Asymmetry**: The model offers a potential explanation for cosmic asymmetries, such as the matter-antimatter imbalance, as consequences of differential flows through multiple time dimensions during the early universe.

4. **Mathematical Framework**: Developing a comprehensive mathematical description presents significant challenges. While an initially Euclidean approach might seem intuitive:

$$ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 + dx_4^2$$

This formulation contradicts relativity's well-established hyperbolic structure. Reconciling these requires careful consideration of how dimensional signatures emerge at different observational scales, potentially through a more general metric:

$$ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu$$

where g_μν varies based on observational context rather than representing fixed values.

5. **Philosophical Implications**: The model challenges fundamental distinctions between past, present, and future, suggesting these emerge from our specific dimensional relationship rather than representing absolute categories.

### 7. Conclusion

This paper proposes that the fundamental distinction between time and space represents an artifact of our observational perspective rather than an intrinsic feature of reality. By reconceptualizing spacetime as a neutral manifold whose dimensional properties depend on the observer's reference frame, we can potentially reconcile various theoretical approaches while generating testable predictions.

The model suggests that beyond the speed of light—while physically inaccessible—space would manifest directional properties like time, while time would become navigable like space. This framework maintains consistency with established physics in conventional reference frames while offering new interpretive possibilities for quantum phenomena and cosmological questions.

I invite the physics community to refine the mathematical framework presented here, develop more precise experimental proposals, and explore the rich implications of dimensional neutrality for our understanding of reality. The greatest advances in physics have often come from recognizing that apparent dichotomies—such as wave and particle, or space and time—reflect observational limitations rather than fundamental divisions. Perhaps the time-space distinction represents the next such boundary to dissolve into deeper unity.
